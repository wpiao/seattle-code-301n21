# Class 5: Putting it all together

## Overview

Today we will use the skills we learned over the week to build a new application: city explorer! Your lab will be to take React starter code and turn it into a beautiful portfolio.

## Daily Plan

- Feedback review
- Code challenge review: `.sort()`
- [Warm-up exercise](./warm-up.md)
- Build City Explorer (React)
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing lecture 5 of Code 301, students will:

- Be able to build a React app that passes props from parent component to child component
- Hold state in the application
- Use forms in React
- Conditionally render data

## Feedback Review

- Lectures have been shorter/more on time
  - Got both positive and negative feedback
- Code challenges are "dope", "cool"
- Code review is helpful for putting it all together
- Wish there was more focus on React data flow in week 1
  - Agreed! We're adding it to the curriculum for next round.
